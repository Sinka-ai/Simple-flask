# Simple Web Server Project 

Hey there! xD

This is my little experiment to understand how web servers and frameworks like Flask work under the hood. Instead of just using Flask right away, I decided to build a super basic web server from scratch using Python's `socket` library. It’s nothing fancy, but it’s a fun way to get a grasp of the fundamentals!
